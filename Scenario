Scenario:

A financial services company wants to create a Stock Price Monitoring and Alert System to improve decision-making for investors and traders. The system should continuously ingest stock price data, perform real-time transformations and aggregations, and trigger alerts when specific conditions are met (e.g., price changes significantly within a short period). The goal is to build a scalable and efficient data pipeline for real-time analysis and notification.
Tasks for the Data Engineer

* Stream Setup:
    ﻿﻿Set up a streaming platform to ingest real-time stock data.
* ﻿﻿Real-Time Processing:
    Compute aggregated metrics (max, min, average prices) for each stock.

Detect anomalies based on pre-defined thresholds (e.g., price change >5% in 1 minute).

* ﻿﻿Integration with Downstream Systems:
    Write processed data to a persistent store (e.g., Amazon S3) from where downstream users like data analysts, data scientists can interact with the data
